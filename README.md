## Introduction

In this project, a mini NESSUS VULNERABILITY LAB and Remediation will be created. These are two  main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. We will be using Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation. The metrics we will show are:

-  Install VMWare Player
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- Download and Install Nessus Essentials
- Setup Virtual Machine
-  Create a new scan in Nessus
-  Inspecting the first scan (no credentials)
-  Configuring VM for credentialed scans
-  First scan with credentials
-  Inspecting First scan with credentials results
-  Installing a deprecated Firefox on our VM
-   Inspect scan results after installing deprecated firefox
-   Remediating some vulnerabilities
-   Inspect scan results after remediating some vulnerabilities

## Download and install VirtualBox or VMWware Workstation Player for free: https://www.vmware.com/products/works... 
   ... make sure you bridge your NIC in order use same network or internet with the host computer
## https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
Download Nessus Essentials - https://www.tenable.com/products/ness... 
Install Nessus Essentials (get activation code from your email)
[nessus key]
http://localhost:8834/WelcomeToNessus-Install/welcome


## Result of Authenticated(Non-Credential) Scanning Using NESSUS ESSENTIAL
Steps Before the result.
1. Get the IP from the VM
2. Make sure you can the IP by pinging otherwise turn the VM firewall off.
3. Type in the VM ip address into NESSUS ESSENTIAL basic scan new scan.

## To perform Credentialed vulnerability scanning
Setting up the vm to accept authenticated scanning as required by NESSUS.

1. On the virtual machine, type services.msc to enable Remore Registry to (Automatic).

2. Enable "File and Printer Sharing"by typing "Share" on the windows search. Make sure the network discovery,click on "manage advanced sharing settings" file and printer sharing is turn on.

          ... you should see something like the image above
3. Go to user account control, disabled by moving the arrow " do not notify me"
Note: It’s not necessary to do this step 3

4. Open the Registry (regedit) go to HKEY_Local_Machine\software\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\Policies\System
5. Then create a LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy file. Modify to 1. 

6. Restart you VM. Go Back to NESSUS and configure for credentialed scanning by typing the VM name. You can go to command prompt and type “whoami” add the VM and go ahead and scan and compare your scanning with the initial non-credential scanning. Observer the report.

1. Install outdated Firefox, https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/r.
2. Install any other depracated software in the VM.
3. Rescan again, observe the result and compare with the two previous scanned report.
Go ahead and uninstalled and Align Nessus scans with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) by mapping vulnerabilities to the framework's core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
4. Rescan and observe the report.

## Conclusion

This lab is aim at showing how Nessus is a powerful tool for vulnerability management tool that plays a crucial role in securing modern IT environments. By offering comprehensive scanning, reporting, and remediation capabilities, it empowers organizations to proactively manage their security vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of cyberattacks and data breaches. Implementing Nessus as part of your security strategy can contribute to a stronger and more resilient cybersecurity posture.
